# CineScreen

> Cinematic screen recording for macOS — turn raw captures into polished product videos.

Native macOS screen recorder built in Swift, SwiftUI, and Metal. Capture any
window, display, or region with **ScreenCaptureKit**; polish it in a per-frame
timeline editor with smooth cursor motion, automatic zooms, and gradient
backdrops; then export through an **AVAssetWriter** pipeline that never drops a
frame.

Free and open source (MIT) · macOS 14+ · Apple Silicon & Intel.

## Features

### 🎥 Capture — pixel-perfect ScreenCaptureKit
Apple's native capture API drives every frame. Pick a window, a display, or a
region — CineScreen pipes the raw stream straight into a Metal compositor.

### ✨ Compose — polish without thinking
Smooth cursor motion, automatic click highlights, and zoom keyframes you tune
in the timeline. Style recordings with gradient backdrops, padding, and rounded
window chrome.

### 📦 Export — AVAssetWriter, no compromises
A dedicated export compositor renders the final video offline at a locked frame
rate. ProRes or H.264, no dropped frames, signed and notarized `.dmg`.

## How it works

A whole studio in your menu bar. CineScreen sits quietly until you need it — tap
record, pick a window, and the editor opens with your clip already loaded.

1. **Install** — drag CineScreen into Applications; the menu-bar icon appears on first launch.
2. **Grant access** — enable Screen Recording for CineScreen in System Settings, then relaunch.
3. **Record** — open the floating control bar, pick a window or display, hit record. Stop, and your clip drops straight into the editor.
4. **Export** — style, scrub, and tune; the Metal compositor renders every frame offline at a locked frame rate.

## Auto-updates

CineScreen updates itself in place via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org).
Because the app is replaced at its existing path, macOS keeps the Screen
Recording / Accessibility permissions you already granted — **no re-granting
after updates**. The app verifies each download against an embedded EdDSA key
before installing. See [docs/UPDATES.md](docs/UPDATES.md) for the full pipeline.

## Bootstrap

Prereqs: macOS 14+, Xcode 15+, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
make project   # generate CineScreen.xcodeproj from project.yml
make open      # open in Xcode
```

`CineScreen.xcodeproj` is gitignored — it's regenerated from `project.yml`. Edit `project.yml` (not the pbxproj) when adding files or changing settings.

## Build · Run · Release

```bash
make build           # debug build (current arch)
make build-release   # release build (universal)
make archive         # xcarchive for distribution
make export          # signed .app from archive
make dmg             # package .app into .dmg
make notarize        # submit DMG to Apple and staple
make release         # full pipeline
make clean           # nuke build/ and CineScreen.xcodeproj
```

For local notarization, run once:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials cinescreen-notary \
  --apple-id YOU@example.com \
  --team-id JAT3GYBPJ4 \
  --password APP-SPECIFIC-PASSWORD
```

**Cutting a release:** bump `MARKETING_VERSION` in `project.yml`, commit, then push a
`vX.Y.Z` tag. The `.github/workflows/release.yml` pipeline signs with Developer ID,
notarizes, publishes the GitHub Release, and deploys the Sparkle appcast to GitHub
Pages — which auto-updates existing users.
